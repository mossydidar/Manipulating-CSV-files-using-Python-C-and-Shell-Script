# Searching-through-CSV-files-using-Python-C-and-Unix-Shell-Script
I used 3 different languages to iterate through a very large CSV file, read the file, and search for particular entries in the CSV  file according to the desires of the user.   The CSV file contains  exactly 152644 entries (rows).  It has been implemented in 3 different languages to make a comparison between the performances and run-times and other design issues.
